#RPiDS-Cache
Open-Source Digital Signage System

**UNDER DEVELOPMENT!!! DO NOT USE IN A PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENT!**

##Cache Server
This part of the RPiDS system lives on any server that supports PHP and MySQL. Intended to be used on the same LAN as one or more displays, this server reduces load on the Admin Server, decreases display load time (especially on slow internet connections), allows remote control of the display and increases display reliability during internet outages.

_Tip: Make your Cache Server accessable by the Admin Server to enable near-real-time updates and display control._
